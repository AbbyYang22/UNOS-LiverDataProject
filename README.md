# UNOS-LiverDataProject
Machine Learning Models for the Prediction of Post-Liver Transplant Mortality  
- The Real Data Analysis Project is a research project conducted under the supervision of Professor in the Data Science at DePaul University.
- In the Verssion1:  
  - The goal is to predict graft survival at different time points after transplantation using machine learning models.
  - You can see the main report (UNOS_LiverDataProjectReport_Version1.pdf) that includes all the main results and dicussion, but not the code.  
  - The full code can be viewed in "UNOS_LiverDataProject_Version1.ipynb" and "UNOS_LiverDataProject_Version1.html", and both are the same.
- In the Verssion2:
  - The goal is to forecast 90-day post-transplant mortality through machine learning models and assess their performance relative to conventional models.
